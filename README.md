# Hello! I’m James.

I’m a full‑stack software developer passionate about building practical tools, web applications, desktop applications, APIs, bots, and more. Son to a software architect, I've been coding since I was just 9 years old. I'm experienced in developing applications with React, Java, Python, Node, JavaScript, and most recently .NET.
